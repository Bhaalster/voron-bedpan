# Voron Bedpan
A central purge bucket, wago mount, and cover plate for the Voron 2.4
_Name courtesy of Logan#2225_

I created this mod because I switched to using the Euclid probe with a bed mount. I wanted to have a purge bucket but the existing purge bucket mod mounts over the extrusion and I wanted something in the center. I also wanted to use wago mounts, so I decided to combine the bucket mounting and the wago mount. The magnets and the cover are just for convenience and aesthetics.
